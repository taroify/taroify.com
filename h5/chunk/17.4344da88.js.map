you describe a transition from one component\n * state to another _over time_ with a simple declarative API. Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n * name of the component).\n *\n * ---\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 1 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n *   exiting:  { opacity: 0 },\n *   exited:  { opacity: 0 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {state => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete.

The first class is applied and then a\n * second `*-active` class in order to activate the CSS transition. After the\n * transition, matching `*-done` class names are applied to persist the\n * transition state.\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <CSSTransition in={inProp} timeout={200} classNames=\"my-node\">\n *         <div>\n *           {\"I'll receive my-node-* classes\"}\n *         </div>\n *       </CSSTransition>\n *       <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the `in` prop is set to `true`, the child component will first receive\n * the class `example-enter`, then the `example-enter-active` will be added in\n * the next tick. `CSSTransition` [forces a\n * reflow](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\n * between before adding the `example-enter-active`. This is an important trick\n * because it allows us to transition between `example-enter` and\n * `example-enter-active` even though they were added immediately one after\n * another. Most notably, this is what makes it possible for us to animate\n * _appearance_.\n *\n * ```css\n * .my-node-enter {\n *   opacity: 0;\n * }\n * .my-node-enter-active {\n *   opacity: 1;\n *   transition: opacity 200ms;\n * }\n * .my-node-exit {\n *   opacity: 1;\n * }\n * .my-node-exit-active {\n *   opacity: 0;\n *   transition: opacity 200ms;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * `*-active` classes represent which styles you want to animate **to**, so it's\n * important to add `transition` declaration only to them, otherwise transitions\n * might not behave as intended! This might not be obvious when the transitions\n * are symmetrical, i.e. when `*-enter-active` is the same as `*-exit`, like in\n * the example above (minus `transition`), but it becomes apparent in more\n * complex transitions.\n *\n * **Note**: If you're using the\n * [`appear`](http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition#Transition-prop-appear)\n * prop, make sure to define styles for `.appear-*` classes as well.\n */\n\n\nvar CSSTransition = /*#__PURE__*/function (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(CSSTransition, _React$Component);\n\n  function CSSTransition() {\n    var _this;\n\n    for (var _len = arguments.length, args = new Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n      args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n    }\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call.apply(_React$Component, [this].concat(args)) || this;\n    _this.appliedClasses = {\n      appear: {},\n      enter: {},\n      exit: {}\n    };\n\n    _this.onEnter = function (maybeNode, maybeAppearing) {\n      var _this$resolveArgument = _this.resolveArguments(maybeNode, maybeAppearing),\n          node = _this$resolveArgument[0],\n          appearing = _this$resolveArgument[1];\n\n      _this.removeClasses(node, 'exit');\n\n      _this.addClass(node, appearing ?

They are _joined_ with the ones that are already defined on the child\n   *    component, so if you want to add some base styles, you can use\n   *    `className` without worrying that it will be overridden.\n   *\n   * 2. If the transition component mounts with `in={false}`, no classes are\n   *    applied yet. You might be expecting `*-exit-done`, but if you think\n   *    about it, a component cannot finish exiting if it hasn't entered yet.\n   *\n   * 2. `fade-appear-done` and `fade-enter-done` will _both_ be applied. This\n   *    allows you to define different behavior for when appearing is done and\n   *    when regular entering is done, using selectors like\n   *    `.fade-enter-done:not(.fade-appear-done)`. For example, you could apply\n   *    an epic entrance animation when element first appears in the DOM using\n   *    [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/). Otherwise you can\n   *    simply use `fade-enter-done` for defining both cases.\n   *\n   * Each individual classNames can also be specified independently like:\n   *\n   * ```js\n   * classNames={{\n   *  appear: 'my-appear',\n   *  appearActive: 'my-active-appear',\n   *  appearDone: 'my-done-appear',\n   *  enter: 'my-enter',\n   *  enterActive: 'my-active-enter',\n   *  enterDone: 'my-done-enter',\n   *  exit: 'my-exit',\n   *  exitActive: 'my-active-exit',\n   *  exitDone: 'my-done-exit',\n   * }}\n   * ```\n   *\n   * If you want to set these classes using CSS Modules:\n   *\n   * ```js\n   * import styles from './styles.css';\n   * ```\n   *\n   * you might want to use camelCase in your CSS file, that way could simply\n   * spread them instead of listing them one by one:\n   *\n   * ```js\n   * classNames={{ ...styles }}\n   * ```\n   *\n   * @type {string | {\n   *  appear?: string,\n   *  appearActive?: string,\n   *  appearDone?: string,\n   *  enter?: string,\n   *  enterActive?: string,\n   *  enterDone?: string,\n   *  exit?: string,\n   *  exitActive?: string,\n   *  exitDone?: string,\n   * }}\n   */\n  classNames: classNamesShape,\n\n  /**\n   * A `<Transition>` callback fired immediately after the 'enter' or 'appear' class is\n   * applied.\n   *\n   * **Note**: when `nodeRef` prop is passed, `node` is not passed.\n   *\n   * @type Function(node: HtmlElement, isAppearing: bool)\n   */\n  onEnter: PropTypes.func,\n\n  /**\n   * A `<Transition>` callback fired immediately after the 'enter-active' or\n   * 'appear-active' class is applied.\n   *\n   * **Note**: when `nodeRef` prop is passed, `node` is not passed.\n   *\n   * @type Function(node: HtmlElement, isAppearing: bool)\n   */\n  onEntering: PropTypes.func,\n\n  /**\n   * A `<Transition>` callback fired immediately after the 'enter' or\n   * 'appear' classes are **removed** and the `done` class is added to the DOM node.\n   *\n   * **Note**: when `nodeRef` prop is passed, `node` is not passed.\n   *\n   * @type Function(node: HtmlElement, isAppearing: bool)\n   */\n  onEntered: PropTypes.func,\n\n  /**\n   * A `<Transition>` callback fired immediately after the 'exit' class is\n   * applied.\n   *\n   * **Note**: when `nodeRef` prop is passed, `node` is not passed\n   *\n   * @type Function(node: HtmlElement)\n   */\n  onExit: PropTypes.func,\n\n  /**\n   * A `<Transition>` callback fired immediately after the 'exit-active' is applied.\n   *\n   * **Note**: when `nodeRef` prop is passed, `node` is not passed\n   *\n   * @type Function(node: HtmlElement)\n   */\n  onExiting: PropTypes.func,\n\n  /**\n   * A `<Transition>` callback fired immediately after the 'exit' classes\n   * are **removed** and the `exit-done` class is added to the DOM node.\n   *\n   * **Note**: when `nodeRef` prop is passed, `node` is not passed\n   *\n   * @type Function(node: HtmlElement)\n   */\n  onExited: PropTypes.func\n}) : {};\nexport default CSSTransition;","import hasClass from './hasClass';\nexport default function addClass(element, className) {\n  if (element.classList) element.classList.add(className);else if (!hasClass(element, className)) if (typeof element.className === 'string') element.className = element.className + \" \" + className;else element.setAttribute('class', (element.className && element.className.baseVal || '') + \" \" + className);\n}","export default function hasClass(element, className) {\n  if (element.classList) return !!className && element.classList.contains(className);\n  return (\" \" + (element.className.baseVal || element.className) + \" \").indexOf(\" \" + className + \" \") !== -1;\n}","import \"../../styles/style\"\r\nimport \"../index.scss\"\r\n","// THIS FILE IS GENERATED - DO NOT EDIT!\n/*!mobile-detect v1.4.5 2021-03-13*/\n/*global module:false, define:false*/\n/*jshint latedef:false*/\n/*!@license Copyright 2013, Heinrich Goebl, License: MIT, see https://github.com/hgoebl/mobile-detect.js*/\n(function (define, undefined) {\ndefine(function () {\n    'use strict';\n\n    var impl = {};\n\n    impl.mobileDetectRules = {\n    \"phones\": {\n        \"iPhone\": \"\\\\biPhone\\\\b|\\\\biPod\\\\b\",\n        \"BlackBerry\": \"BlackBerry|\\\\bBB10\\\\b|rim[0-9]+|\\\\b(BBA100|BBB100|BBD100|BBE100|BBF100|STH100)\\\\b-[0-9]+\",\n        \"Pixel\": \"; \\\\bPixel\\\\b\",\n        \"HTC\": \"HTC|HTC.*(Sensation|Evo|Vision|Explorer|6800|8100|8900|A7272|S510e|C110e|Legend|Desire|T8282)|APX515CKT|Qtek9090|APA9292KT|HD_mini|Sensation.*Z710e|PG86100|Z715e|Desire.*(A8181|HD)|ADR6200|ADR6400L|ADR6425|001HT|Inspire 4G|Android.*\\\\bEVO\\\\b|T-Mobile G1|Z520m|Android [0-9.]+; Pixel\",\n        \"Nexus\": \"Nexus One|Nexus S|Galaxy.*Nexus|Android.*Nexus.*Mobile|Nexus 4|Nexus 5|Nexus 5X|Nexus 6\",\n        \"Dell\": \"Dell[;]?
